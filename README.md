A collection of workflows for Alfred 2.0

## Shortcat Alfred Launcher 0.01
This simple workflow launches Shortcat (with the "ui" keyword) and runs 
it with the Alfred query. It's a simple bridge between Shortcat and Alfred.

Since SC is not scriptable (Yet!) this is merely a keypress simulation.

WARNING: This workflow assumes you are using {CMD-SHIFT-SPACE} (the default)
as your Shortcat trigger. If not, you may have to modify the AppleScript
included in the workflow for your needs.
